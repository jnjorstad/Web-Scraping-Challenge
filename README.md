# Web-Scraping-Challenge
In this project, I scraped the Mars News Site, Mars Facts webpage, and the astrogeology site to get the latest news article title, the latest news article intro paragraph, and images for each hemisphere of Mars. Then, I was able to use MongoDB with Flask to create a new HTML page that displayed all of the information that I scraped.
